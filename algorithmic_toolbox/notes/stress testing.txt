1. Use an infinite loop to generate random test cases
2. Implement two quite different algorithms for solving the target problem (usually one of the algorithms can be naive/brutal)
3. Run the test cases on the algorithms
4. If there are any different answers, print them out and think what may be the cause of the bug
5. Try to generate the simpliest cases which will illicit the bug, and use the cases to debug the algorithm
# Note: if there are different answers, the correctness of the algorithms can be one wrong and one correct or two wrong ones
